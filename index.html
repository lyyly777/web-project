    <p>
      Help Street Cats and Dogs was established in 2023 by lyly, who was deeply
      moved by the plight of street cats and dogs during a trip to Turkey.
      Witnessing the harsh and dangerous conditions these animals faced, with
      many not surviving beyond a few months, Isabel felt compelled to take
      action. The alarming number of unneutered cats and dogs roaming the
      streets resulted in a continuous cycle of kittens and puppies being born
      into a life of misery. This drove Isabel to found Help Street Cats and
      Dogs. Isabel is a dedicated advocate for animal welfare, actively raising
      awareness about the suffering endured by all animals. With her extensive
      experience in international rescue operations, she frequently provides
      guidance to other rescue groups on conducting safe rescue missions abroad.
      Her commitment to making a difference shines through her work with Help
      Street Cats and Dogs. Isabel's passion and expertise have made a
      significant impact in the animal welfare community, serving as an
      inspiration for others to join the cause.
